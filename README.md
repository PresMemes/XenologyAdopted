To be honest, this mod wasn't that broken.

Changes compared to the original version:
- Removed the deprecated [modification = no] tag for leader traits
- Gave edicts funds instead of edict cap for a few traits
- I couldn't find a modifier for worker pop job upkeep, so I just gave a weaker all job upkeep bonus instead.
- Optimized the events file by removing redundent OR checks, standardized NOT/NORs, and replaced blocks of IF statements with switches.
- Changed trait_sluggish_desc localization to refer to the correct trait, Inert
- Updated thumbnail to identify this mod as a fan update, not an official module.
- Added in some missing tooltips
